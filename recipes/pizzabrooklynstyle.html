    <p>This simple brick-oven pizza recipe has been made famous by several well-known, Brooklyn wood-fire pizzerias.</p>
    <p>This recipe assumes you already have a pizza base or dough.</p>
    <p>Servings:2 Pizzas</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C).</p>
            <p>Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Put pizza base on peel.</p>
            <p>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. </p>
            <p>Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <p>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface.</p>
            <p>Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza.</p>
            <p>Cut into wedges and serve.</p>
        </li>
        <br>
